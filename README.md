# Axon-Fasciculation
Following work is the part of my research project in biophysics under Dr Abhishek Chaudhari, Associate Professor, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali, India. The work models axon fasciculation under Monte Carlo scheme on a matrix area. Further improvements are being done on biophysical interactions to model close-to-reality scenarios.
